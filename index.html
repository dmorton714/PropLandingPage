            <p>
              PropMG is built differently from the competition. We go beyond simply listing properties
              and collecting rent — our goal is to give you a comprehensive understanding of your portfolio,
              covering not only the financials but also detailed property insights that go far beyond the
              basics. 
            </p>

            <h3>Inventory:</h3>
            <p>
              We give you the flexibility to track each property as broadly or as detailed as you’d like. From major assets
              like roofs, HVAC systems, and appliances to smaller items such as light switches, every detail can be logged.
              This makes vendor services seamless by keeping equipment information, model numbers, and install dates in one
              place — simplifying the repair process. Even better, our system alerts you when items are approaching the end
              of their lifecycle, helping you anticipate issues and plan ahead instead of being caught off guard.
            </p>
          </div>
  

          <div class="about__text">
            <h3>Maintenance Management:</h3>
            <p>
              Our platform lets both you and your tenants submit work orders, giving you full control to approve, deny, and assign vendors.
              With our built-in vendor management system, you can place orders directly with approved vendors and rate their
              performance — ensuring only trusted professionals handle your properties. Repairs are simplified, efficient, and
              reliable. Prefer to use your own vendors? No problem — PropMG gives you the flexibility to manage maintenance your way.
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about__text">
              <h3>Payments:</h3>
              <p>
                We know that payments, whether collecting rent or invoicing tenants, are often a headache. PropMG simplifies
                the entire process by handling payments directly within the application. Completed transactions are automatically
                documented, added to your books, and reflected in dashboards and reports, giving you a clear, stress-free view of
                your finances.
